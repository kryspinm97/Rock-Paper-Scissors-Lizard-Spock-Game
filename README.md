# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game #

Here I have created a Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game which originated from the great TV show called The Big Bang Theory.
It consists of your basic Rock Paper Scissors Rules along with two more choices for a bit more of a twist into the game. Here you get a chance to battle it out against the computer in a best of 10 at which whoever gets to 10 first wins!.

# UX #

## User Stories ##

  * As the site owner I want : 
  
    * Create a visually appealing, responsive game
    * Functional yet Simple to navigate and use
    * Not cluttered visually and with everything clear to the user
    * Provide a set of rules for players understanding of the game
    * Contain a reset button in a case where player wants to start over again
    * Incrementing score for both the player and computer

  * As the user, I would want : 

    * To have the ability to play against a computer
    * Easily navigate game buttons and options
    * Have the information about rules available to me
    * Be able to play again after finishing game

## 1. Strategy ##

  * Purpose of the Project 

    * Let users have a try at the game against the Computer in a best of 10 style (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard and Spock) game. 

## 2. Scope ## 

  * I wanted a aesthetically clean UI
  * I wanted an ability to play against the computer
  * I wanted to have a popup modal that displays the set of rules on click
  * I wanted to have a popup modal that comes up after the game is finished with the game result of whichever player won, with the ability to Play Again.
  * I wanted a reset button in case user wanted to start over.

## 3. Structure ##

* Header consisting of the Game Name , identifying it to the user of what it is about.
* Player and Computer central score area, that holds the score count for both the Player and Computer, which increments while winning / losing rounds.
* An Element that comes up with a round result message if you have won or lost or it was a draw. 
* A layout of interactive buttons that display the game options of (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard and Spock).
* Option Buttons that allow the user to click Play to begin the game, click Rules to display the rules of the game and click reset to start the game over again.
* Copyright footer at the bottom of the page to credit the creator.

## 4. Skeleton ## 

* I have used the Balsamiq Wireframes software for the initial development of this project which helped me guide my mind onto where to place my game elements and information.

## 5. Surface ##

 * Theme Selection 
    * I have went with a linear gradient option for the theme background of my page as I felt like it is least invasive of grabbing attention away from the player if I was to use a game-style background.

  * Font Selection 
    * The font I have went with for this project is : Questrial , which I have sourced from the google fonts page.
